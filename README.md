# NSbirthMass
NSbirthMass is a Python source code containing tools for 1. computing the neutron star birth mass distribution under various accretion modes. 2. performing rapid parameter estimation and model selection for different neutron star mass models.

# Overview
NSbirthMass is designed to offer a wider range of neutron star mass distribution models, faster parameter estimation and model selection. It includes commonly used Gaussian series models and utilizes the Nested sampling method for parameter estimation. This source code aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient way to conduct calculations. NSbirthMass can be directly downloaded from GitHub and is compatible with the GNU/Linux operating system.

# Setting up the development environment:

## To set up Slurm for parallel parameters estimationï¼š
### 1. Install Slurm.
### 2. Configure Python Environment: Set up your Python environment in "slurm.sh" files.
#### For example: cd NSbirthMass/pe_models/ns_obs/2G/ folder; find the slurm.sh file; modify the last line command in the "slurm.sh" file, which is "python hyper.py," to use your specific Python environment, such as "/home/xxx/miniconda/envs/xxx/bin/python hyper.py".
### 3. Generate Neutron Star mass data. 
#### Use the NS mass generation code located in the "NSbirthMass/demos/" directory to obtain neutron star mass data under different accretion modes.
### 4. Copy NS mass data in "NSbirthMass/demos/" to the parameters estimation folder, "NSbirthMass/pe_models".

## To run parallel parameters estimation based on task management system using NS mass data obtained above:
### cd /NSbirthMass/pe_models/xxx/yyy ; sbatch slurm.sh, or cd /NSbirthMass/pe_models/xxx; bash sbatch 
#### where the "xxx" folder represents the accretion mode for NS mass data, such as analytical approach (obs), and "yyy" indicates the mass model, like Gaussian distribution(G).

### Note
#### We employed the Slurm task management system. In this calculation, we used single-node parallel processing. When performing parallel calculations, ensure that the "logs/" directory is created before submitting the "slurm.sh" file. The "ntasks-per-node" specifies the number of threads per node for parallel computation. Please note that "npool" should match the "ntasks-per-node" value specified in the "slurm.sh" file. Before submitting a parallel task, make sure to switch the Python environment in "slurm.sh" file, the last line of command, which can be determined using the "which python" command.

## To run notebooks
### cd demos
### run jupyter notebook, xxx.ipynb
